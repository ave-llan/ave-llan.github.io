    I'm a software engineer at Google, currently focused on mapping the world's buildings.
  </p>
  <p>
    I studied music composition and my music has been performed by groups such as the US Navy Band, Zzyzx Quartet, and the Akropolis Quintet.

   <p>
   I'm still interested in sound and am currently exploring field recording and different ways to visualize sound. Other interests include plants; particularly  oaks, madrones, and their habitats.
