    I studied music composition but ended up a birder and software engineer. I'm still interested in sound and am currently exploring field recording and different ways to visualize sound. Other interests include plants; I have a particular affinity for oaks, madrones, and their habitats.

    I grew up in Indiana then lived in DC and now Seattle where I work on Google Maps.
