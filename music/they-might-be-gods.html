<i>Companion poem by Claire Ensley</i>

<br><br>

Awake.<br>
A rustle, a snap<br>
Footsteps and shadows and<br>
Eyes<br>
Seeing, unseen.<br>
<br>

Pursuit.<br>
Chasing or chased,<br>
It's unclear. Running<br>
Just run<br>
Run<br>
Run. Until<br>
Tripping, trapped.<br>
<br>

Your quest, sir?<br>
Yes, a quest.<br>
A quest and a map and a bear.<br>
A dancing bear?<br>
Twirls, too delicately<br>
Faster. Faster, then fading.<br>
Gone.<br>
<br>

Falling.<br>
Falling, sveltely.<br>
Look-Raindrops!<br>
Tiny gleaming globes<br>
Falling too<br>
Falling, faster<br>
The ground-but no collision.<br>
<br>

And light.<br>
Asleep?<br>
Light-Somewhere far?<br>
No.<br>
Watching lanterns<br>
Through a glass darkly.<br>
And seen face to face<br>
They might be gods<br>
