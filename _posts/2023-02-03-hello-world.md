It is still dark, and rain pings softly on a metal chimney cap. The sound is carried down into a basement where, for some time, I have sat at a small desk selecting words to project from this private space onto a screen, on the other side of which, are you. 

Hello, and thanks for reading. 

Crossing that threshold from private to public was not so easy for me -- I am out of practice. But here I am. So why do it now? It's not exactly the need for an audience; in fact, I'm choosing to imagine the other side of this screen as a readerless corner in a vast wilderness which is nevertheless a public space, you yourself proving the fact.
 
In this basement, I have filled a growing stack of notebooks with private writing, meant to clarify ideas and experiences but with only my future self as the audience. I've also spent many hours learning about sound and signal processing, tinkering on various projects like this website, and most of all working slowly towards a recurring vision I have, of visual art derived from sound.

I imagine things like a hyperdetailed representation of a Pine Siskin flocks upward screech, or a long stream of calligraphic marks derived from a Pacific Wren's song, or a visualization of a dawn chorus in a place from first sound until last, but compressed into some beautiful timeline of colored marks. A beautiful map of sound, unique to a place. My hpe is that htey would be beautiful representations of information -- the actual songs and sounds -- but also beautiful as abstract marks, fixed on a page -- even if a person didn't know what they represent. Like a symbolic language, mysterious calligraphy or primitive and dream-like as in a Toldedo print. 

I'm so far from anything like that, but I have made progress. I made a tool to visualize sound, which forced me to learn more about sound itself, sound recording, signal processing. I've been looking more closely at art books, finding favorite artists, planned trips to make recordings.

Through publishing, I'm looking for a focusing effect.  To enter a public space a piece of work needs a frame and so becomes a thing, pulled out of an amorphous stream of writing and gradual progress on small projects. 

It is still dark, but now it is not raining. In fact, it is now another morning. When I woke up today a coyote was howling and yapping from down the street in Discovery Park. The first time I've heard that from this house in 5 years of living here. I made a note in my notebook.
