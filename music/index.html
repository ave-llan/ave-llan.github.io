           Inspired by the fugue at the end of Benjamin Britten's <i>A Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra</i>, <a href="/music/scherzo-a-la-britten.html">Scherzo &agrave la Britten</a> is a virtuosic showpiece for wind ensemble.

           <a href="/music/the-builder.html">The Builder</a> opens with a simple rhythm in the woodwinds. This 'building' motive gradually intensifies and a lyrical trumpet solo emerges with the beginnings of a melody. The infant melody is molded by hammer swings from the percussion and the woodwinds' constant chiseling. After a number of metric modulations and rhythmic transformations, the building rhythm soon reaches a fever pitch and is funneled into one final hammer swing, with the whole ensemble in unison.

           Infamous for its many rules, species counterpoint applies restrictions on both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of music. The result is a kind of musical sudoku puzzle in which every decision resonates out in multiple directions. <a href="/music/variations-in-the-reeds.html">Variations in the Reeds</a> takes a species counterpoint theme and puts it through a different rhythmic prism in each movement.

           From the beginning of <a href="/music/for-whom-the-bell-tolls.html">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>, a simple,  repeating figure sounds in the pianos. As the long tones of the clarinet and strings begin to form a melody, the piano motive sounds with ever-increasing urgency. The pianos eventually evolve into a pseudo-carillon, rich with clanging overtones.
