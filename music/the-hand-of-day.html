The Hand of Day is a three minute minimalist piece for piano on the shortest of poems by Octavio Paz:
<br><br>
The hand of day opens<br>
Three clouds<br>
And these few words<br>
<br>
Using a limited range and an always sounding eighth note pulse, this piece explores horizontal rhythmic groupings. Each of the arrival points uses a slightly more dissonant combination than the last (2 vs 3, 3 vs 4, and eventually 4 vs 5).
