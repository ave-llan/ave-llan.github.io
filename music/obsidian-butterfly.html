Itzpapalotl the "Obsidian Butterfly" was an Aztec warrior god, said to rule over the paradise world of Tamoanchan where the gods created the human race. 
<br><br>
Itzpapalotl changes forms several times in the piece, and with her, the same melodic material is transformed from lyrical to fierce dance-like sections. At the climax of the piece, Itzpapalotl's main motive is combined for the first time with all of the other important melodic material from the piece.
