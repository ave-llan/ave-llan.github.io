In the Garry Oak courtyard, I lean back against the glass patio door, my skin pleasantly warmed by the sun through cool air.  Golden-crowned Sparrows forage in fallen leaves which at times lift up around them in swirling gusts of wind. I watch and wait for a feeling of wonder, but it doesn't come. So I attempt to will it: I try to melt back into the glass, to become invisible; just seeing and hearing, an attention with no history or worry. 

Wind-dispersed seeds flurry, fantastic specks revealing instability in the bright air; crazy, curling patterns with an overall arc of direction. I close my eyes and listen to the wind and shimmering leaves.

If I could be just this, this attention, I could exist here pleasurably, forever. Through sun and rain, bright days and dreary too, towhees and juncos scratching in the gloom. All beautiful to the unjudging eyes and ears.

Hummingbirds at the feeder, all this magic, right here, now, and still too often I can't feel it. I desire to desire, to change, to want to create. Should I break this last desire? Maybe I'd vanish into the glass here, into the now, forever. And all the things around would open to me in a new vision, estatic wonder at the hummingbird, the spots on the woodpecker, the fountain of Iris leaves, browning at the tips, seed pods overflowing.
