In the Garry Oak courtyard, I lean back against the glass patio door emptied of desire, but skin pleasantly warmed by the sun through the cool air. Golden-crowned Sparrows forage in the leaves, and in the gusting waves of wind, I try to melt back into the glass, to become invisible: just seeing and hearing, an attention with no history or worry. Wind-dispersed seeds flurry in the bright air, fantastic specks tracing the movement of the air, a curling pattern, with an overall arc of direction.

This attention could sit here invisibly, pleasurably, forever. Through sun and rain, bright days and dismal, towhees and juncos scratching in the gloom. All beautiful to the unjudging eyes and ears.

Hummingbirds at the feeder, all this other magic, right here, now, and still I desire to desire, to change, to want to create. Should I break this last desire? Maybe I'd vanish into the glass here, into the now, forever. And all the things around would open to me in a new vision, estatic wonder at the hummingbird, the spots on the woodpecker, the fountain of Iris leaves, browning at the tips, seed pods overflowing.
