In the Garry Oak courtyard, I lean back against the glass patio door, my skin pleasantly warmed by the sun through the cool air. Golden-crowned Sparrows forage in the leaves amongst gusting waves of wind. I watch but feel emptied of desire. I try to melt back into the glass, to become invisible; just seeing and hearing, an attention with no history or worry. 

Wind-dispersed seeds flurry, fantastic specks revealing swirling movements of the bright air, a curling pattern, with an overall arc of direction. 

This attention could sit here invisibly, pleasurably, forever. Through sun and rain, bright days and dismal, towhees and juncos scratching in the gloom. All beautiful to the unjudging eyes and ears.

Hummingbirds at the feeder, all this other magic, right here, now, and still too often I can't feel it. I desire to desire, to change, to want to create. Should I break this last desire? Maybe I'd vanish into the glass here, into the now, forever. And all the things around would open to me in a new vision, estatic wonder at the hummingbird, the spots on the woodpecker, the fountain of Iris leaves, browning at the tips, seed pods overflowing.
