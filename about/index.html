    I studied music composition but ended up a birder and software engineer. I'm still interested in sound and am currently exploring field recording and different ways to visualize sound. Other interests include plants; I have a particular affinity for oaks, madrones, and their habitats.

    My music has been performed by groups such as the US Navy Band, US Army Field Band, the Barkada Quartet, Zzyzx Quartet, and the Akropolis Quintet.
