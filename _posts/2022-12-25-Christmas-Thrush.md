All morning and into afternoon, a Varied Thrush foraged in the leaf litter of the backyard garden. It was the first here this winter, a beautiful bird unlike anything else, with slate blue, burnt orange, and black markings. If you asked me a little over five years ago when we lived in DC, a sighting like this, in our own yard, was a vision of contentedness, a symbol of an ideal future life. And there it was, first seen through the bathroom window while brushing my teeth after breakfast.

The first time I heard a Varied Thrush was in the Olympic Mountains, near treeline, on my first trip to Seattle with Carlos. We'd already hiked several miles up the Heather Park trail. As the trees thinned and we reached the first ridgeline (ahead: mountain basin with bare rock and scree, patches of snow, and stands of thin subalpine fir), that haunting whistle rang through the air. Then silence. Then another whistle on a lower note, filling the basin ahead. A long pause, then a new note, the song eerie and magical in its simplicity: the unhurried silences, the single sustained note, only varying in pitch from note to note. 

A few months later, back home in DC, I held the button on the side of my phone to leave a message for my future self, saying, "Remind me in five years that my ideal life is a small apartment in the city, and a small cabin in the mountains where Varied Thrushes sing." 

It's not exactly like that—we live in a residential neighborhood of Seattle, no mountain cabin—but the thrushes do sing in late winter from the conifers across the street. And there is this one now, flipping through the leaves that I swept from the patio last month and spread throughout the garden.  When I got that reminder from my past self a little over a year ago, and when I looked out at that thrush today there is an intellectual awe to see some vision from the past so close to true, but also a vacant feeling, like memory of desire, the longing felt more than its realization.

Now I try to orientate less towards idealized futures like that, and instead on writing things like this, and watching the thrush before me more closely. Their shyness, how on approach they retreat upwards from the forest floor into the branches of conifers above, a pale orange stripe sometimes visible in the blur of dark wingbeats, sometimes just a notion.
